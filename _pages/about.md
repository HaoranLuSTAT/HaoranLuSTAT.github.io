My name is Haoran Lu, and I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at the University of Georgia. I am currently working in the Big Data Analytics Lab, supervised by Professor [Ping Ma](https://bdalpingio.github.io/) and Professor [Wenxuan Zhong](https://zhonglabuga.github.io/). I received my Master's degree in Statistics from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2021. My research interests include causal inference, large language models (LLMs), artificial generative model, and bioinformatics.
